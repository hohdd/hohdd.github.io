## TO And FOR

<div class="w3-card w3-leftbar w3-border-red w3-pale-red w3-panel w3-padding-16">
Don’t say: “I’m studying every day for improve my English.”
</div>
<div class="w3-card w3-leftbar w3-border-green w3-pale-green w3-panel w3-padding-16">
Say: “I’m studying every day to improve my English.”
</div>

The prepositions to and for are very easy to confuse! Here are some rules:

- Use TO In These Cases:
    - **Destination (Đích đến)**: “We’re going to Paris.”
    - **What time it is**: “It’s a quarter to 2.”
    - **Distance (Khoảng cách)**: “It’s about ten miles from my house to the university.”
    - **Comparing (So sánh)**: “I prefer sleeping to working.”
    - **Giving (Đưa/Trao/Tặng**: “I gave the book to my sister.”
    - **Motive/Reason (Động cơ/Lý do) – with verb**: “I came here to see you.”

- Use FOR In These Cases:
    - **Benefits (Những lợi ích)**: “Yogurt is good for your digestion.”
    - **Period of time (Khoảng thời gian)**: “We’ve lived here for 2 years.”
    - **Schedule (Lịch trình)**: “I made an appointment for May 3.”
    - **Agree with (Đồng ý)**: “Are you for or against the development of nuclear weapons?”
    - **Doing something to help someone**: “Could you carry these books for me?”
    - **Motive/Reason (Động cơ/Lý do) – with noun**: “Let’s go out for a drink.”
    - **Function (Chức năng) – with verb (-ing form)**: “A ladle is a big spoon used for serving soup.”

As you can see in #6, **TO** or **FOR** can be used for a **motive/reason**, but *TO is always with a verb*, and **FOR is always with a noun**. Here’s a good example:
- I came to New York  to work.
- I came to New York  for a new job.
