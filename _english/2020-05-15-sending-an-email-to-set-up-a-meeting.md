My name is Essie High, and I am a realtor in Jacksonville. I met your friend Brian Wallace at a town hall meeting last night, and he informed me that I might be able to help you relocate your office. I have successfully found new homes for several local businesses with complicated needs, including a brewery and a nonprofit children’s preschool, so I am confident that I can assist you. 

I would love to meet you over lunch one day next week, perhaps at Straub’s Steakhouse near your present office. I am available any day Monday through Thursday.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,<br>
Essie High
