Dear Mr./Mrs. {Recipient’s Name},

I am writing this email to inform you that I will not be able to come to work tomorrow as I have a {% tooltip severe [(Adj) dữ dội, mãnh liệt, khốc liệt, nghiêm khắc] %} {% tooltip bout [(N) cơn, lần, lượt, cơn sốt] %} of a {% tooltip migraine headache [(N) chứng đau nửa đầu] %}.

Taking a day from work and resting will help me {% tooltip overcome [(V) vượt qua, chiến thắng, ức chế] %} this and get back to a normal {% tooltip routine [(N) công việc hàng ngày, thói quen] %} the next day. {% tooltip Kindly [vui lòng, có lòng tốt, hảo tâm] %} {% tooltip grant [(V) ban cho, bằng lòng, nhận cho] %} me leave for a day on {date}. In case, I need to take extra days to {% tooltip recuperate [(V) lấy lại sức, làm cho mạnh lại, hồi phục] %}, I will inform you at the earliest.

Please {% tooltip feel free [đừng ngại] %} to contact me at my personal phone number in case of any questions or {% tooltip clarifications [(N) làm cho sáng sủa, làm cho trong, làm cho rõ, làm cho minh bạch, làm cho dễ hiểu] %} about {% tooltip ongoing [đang diễn ra] %} work at the office.

## Urgent work

**Subject**: *Leave Application for a Day*

Hi {Recipient’s Name},

Please {% tooltip treat [(V) luận giải, đối đãi, nghiên cứu, điều đình] %} this email as an application for leave. I would like to inform you that I {% tooltip require [(V) cần thiết, yêu cầu, cần dùng] %} a day of {% tooltip absence [(N) vắng mặt, đi vắng] %} on {date and month}. I need to visit the bank in my hometown for some personal work, and I need to travel there as soon as possible. Clubbing my leave with the weekend enables me to get this done easily and be back by the following Monday morning.

I am including the work plan for the day I will be taking an off to make it easier for you. Please feel free to contact me at my personal number in case of any questions or clarifications.

Sincerely,<br>
{Name}

## Personal

**Subject**: *Leave Application for a Day*

Dear {Recipient’s Name},

This is to inform you that I need a leave on {date and month} as I am in the middle of shifting my apartment. I need to meet my new landlord and finalize the details of the contract. I have left a copy of the work plan with the team so that they do not run into any trouble.

Please feel free to contact me at my personal number in case of any emergency or queries.

Sincerely,<br>
{Name}

## Emergency

**Subject**: *Emergency Leave Application for a Day*

{% tooltip Respected [(V) tôn trọng, kính mến, có quan hệ] %} Sir/Madam,

I am writing this email to inform you that I will not be able to come into work {Date} tomorrow, as I met with an accident on my way home from the office today.

Although it was a {% tooltip minor [(Adj) không quan trọng, nhỏ, phụ] %} accident, the doctor has advised me to stay under {% tooltip observation [(N) quan sát, sự chú ý, sự để ý, sự trinh sát, sự thăm dò] %} at the hospital to make sure that nothing else is wrong.

I have emailed the team my work plan so that there is no delay in the {% tooltip ongoing [đang diễn ra] %} project. I hope you will understand my situation and grant me the required leave.

Sincerely,<br>
{Name}

## Bonus...

I’m writing to let you know that I developed a fever last night. I hoped it would go away by this morning, but it looks like I’m still above normal temperatures. I expect to be back in the office tomorrow, given my temperature goes back to normal.”

<hr>

“I’m going to stay home today to make sure I don’t spread a cold around the office. I will work as I am able, but I’ve asked Cynthia if she can be my backup today just in case.”

<hr>

Hello,

Thank you for reaching out. I’m away from the office today, so please expect a delay in my response. If you have an emergency, please {% tooltip reach out [liên hệ] %} to my supervisor, Mary Mullins, at marym@email.com.

I will be back in the office for regular working hours this Wednesday, 12/5.

Thank you for your patience,

Juan Ramos<br>
Sr. Account Executive

Hi Rajiv,

I wanted to let you know as soon as possible that I will be staying home from work today. Unfortunately, I developed a stomach bug that has made it very difficult to get work done. I went to urgent care last night and was told it should subside within twenty-four hours. I do not expect to be online throughout the day.

While I do expect to be back in the office tomorrow, I’ve asked Kelly to take over for me today in case any emergencies arise. I do have an important call scheduled with a supplier, but my account counterpart, Daniel, has agreed to manage the meeting.

Please let me know if there are any additional steps you’d like me to take to ensure the day runs as smoothly as possible in my absence.

Thank you for understanding,

Flora Jones
